## Simple Travel Blog 
This is a personal Travel Blog I created as part of my assignment for my Web Science and Technology class at the California Polytechnic University, Pomona. The blog is built primarily using HTML and CSS, showcasing my ability to design and structure a visually appealing and functional website.

The content highlights all the countries I’ve traveled to so far, with each section dedicated to a specific destination. I’ve shared my experiences, cherished memories, and personal insights from each country to give readers a glimpse of what made these journeys special to me.

A unique feature of this blog is the photo gallery, where I’ve represented each country with a carefully chosen image styled to resemble a polaroid. These photos symbolize my favorite moments from my travels, capturing the essence of each destination in a nostalgic and artistic way.
